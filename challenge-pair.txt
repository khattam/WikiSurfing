Tacko Fall


To identify the challenge pair with the longest shortest path, I utilized an iterative BFS approach. 
For each vertex in the graph, I executed a BFS traversal starting from that vertex. During each BFS run, 
I tracked the farthest vertex reached from the starting vertex. Once identified, I then calculated the shortest path 
between the starting vertex and the farthest vertex using the provided shortestPath method. 
By comparing the lengths of the shortest paths found in each iteration, I was able to pinpoint the challenge pair with the longest shortest path.
This method ensures a comprehensive search of the graph while efficiently identifying potential challenge pairs.
